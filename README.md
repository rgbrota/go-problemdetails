Problem details [RFC-7807] implementation library written in Go. 

The objective of problem details is to provide a way to carry machine-readable details of errors in a HTTP response to avoid the need to define new error response formats for HTTP APIs. For more information see [RFC-7807](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807).
